# songSearcher
COP 3530 Final Project: a hierarchical list of songs is printed, with the song that uses the most frequent word at the top based on user-search. Songs are filtered based on its popularity and word frequency, which is determined by the number of streams and the number of times a word appears... Implemented by Alex Johnson, Lauren Nigri, and Shane Barrera
